# Stock-Trend-Predictor
I have created this Python model which can be used to predict stock trends. The data used is from 1 January 2001 till the previous day the app is run on the system. Like if I run the app on 7th July 2022, the model will take data from 1st Jan 2001 till 6th July 2002. 
To run the app on your local machine simply enyter the command "streamlit run app.py" in termnal(without the inverted commas).
I have used EICHERMOT.NS as the default ticker. You can predict the stocks of various companies, simply enter the ticker and run.
That's it. Have a nice day!!
